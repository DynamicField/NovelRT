# The repositories file

This configuration file serves as a way to specify where your NovelRT modules are
stored, and use your local version of them.

For example, if you're working on both FumoCement and NovelRT at the same time,
you can specify the `novelrt.fumocement.path` property, and your **local** FumoCement project
will be included to the NovelRT project.

## Properties
* `novelrt.fumocement.path`: The path to your local FumoCement project.
* `novelrt.plugin.path`: The path to your local NovelRT plugin project.
